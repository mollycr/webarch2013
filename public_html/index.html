			<h2>Hello, and welcome to version one of my portfolio page!</h2>
			<p>
				<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
					My name is <span itemProp="name">Molly Robison</span>, and I am a 
					<span itemProp="jobTitle">Student</span> at the <span itemProp="affiliation">UC Berkeley School of Information
					</span>. I was born on <span itemProp="birthDate"> May 3rd, 1992</span>, my email address is 
					<span itemProp="email">mrobison at ischool dot berkeley dot edu</span>, and, if you're contacting me from 1993,
					my fax number is <span itemprop="faxNumber">(123) 456-7890</span>.
				</div>
			</p>

				<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">
					I previously worked at <span itemProp="name">Merit Network, Inc</span>, whose website is <span itemProp="url">
					<a href="http://merit.edu">here</a>. Merit was one of the big players in founding the Internet, and was founded
					in <span itemProp="foundingDate">1966</span>. If you want even more information, you can email Merit at
					<span itemProp="email">www@merit.edu</span> or call them at <span itemProp="telephone">(734) 527-5700</span>.

				<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Recepie">
					One of my favorite recepies to make is <span itemProp="name">Macaroni and Cheese</span>, which I adapted from
					<span itemProp="url"><a href="http://bethsfavoriterecipes.blogspot.com/2010/02/must-make-from-scratch-macaroni-and.html">
					this recepie</a></span> in a couple of ways. I always use <span itemProp="ingredients">sharp white cheddar cheese
					</span>, and a secret ingredient that I'm not telling you.

			<p>	Here, you can find all of the things that I've done during my time at the I School, and probably a few other things as
				well as this goes on. I'm going to keep typing to fill this out so it looks like a real paragraph, but I don't have too
				much else to say. Let's see: I like cats a little more than dogs, but dogs are steadliy growing on me, since cats really
				don't care about you unless you're giving them food. My favorite color is green, but it used to be purple. I always wear
				two different earrings, and I started doing this in 8th grade when I lost one of my favorite earrings, but now I think
				it looks weird to wear two of the same kind.
			</p>
			<p>	I prefer tea to coffee, although coffee is delicious, mostly because if I have a cup of coffee in the morning I'm 
				bouncing off the walls all day. I'm a vegetarian and like to cook and bake, particularly cakes and sweetbreads. I knit, 
				sew and crochet, and am going to start my first sweater pretty soon. I love Thai food, but can only handle meduim spice.
				I 100% prefer beer to wine, which often makes me feel a little out of place, being firmly in wine country. I miss Bells
				Brewery dearly.
			</p>
			<p style="color: grey;">
				Here's a little list of things I like to do, pretty much just for the sake of formatting it differently:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reading (particularly DFW)</li>
				<li>Knitting (particlarly socks)</li>
				<li>Cooking</li>
			</ol>
