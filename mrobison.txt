1. My experience with web architecture: I'm self-taught at some amount of HTML and CSS, and have had one class in web databases that focused on the LAMP stack and another class in web applications through Google App Engine. I have a fair amount of PHP, CSS, and HTML experience, and have done some amount of Javascript, but it was a couple of years ago. I also know a fair amount about protocols etc, having interned at a networking company for a couple of years. The biggest website that I've worked on was a Flickr-clone for the aforementioned databases class, which was written in php and javascript.

2. My favorite features from 2 browsers: In Chrome, which is what I mainly use, my favorite feature is the built-in developer support, particularly highlighting the different divs, because that's always a pain. In Safari, which I've only used a little bit, my favorite feature is the frequently-visited websites that are shown and linked to when you open a new tab. It's not a particularly unique feature, but theirs is prettier than most.
